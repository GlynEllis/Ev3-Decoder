# Ev3-Decoder
A project that includes a detailed report and program of a morse code decoder.

*NOTE* Ev3 software is required to view code in an IDE, but everything needed is included in the report and code screenshots.

The program allows for the ev3 to use multiple sensors to move along a track of dots and dashes, distinguishing colour and sizes. It displays the decoded messages to its onboard display. It will also stop itself once it has finshed the track or is in danger of falling off the track.
